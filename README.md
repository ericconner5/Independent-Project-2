#### By _**Eric Conner**_

## Description

With this quiz an Epicodus student is given three potential outcomes. The courses offered include but are not limited to:
1. C#/.NET
2. Ruby/Rails
3. CSS/react

By completing the questionnaire the student can get an idea on which of these tracks suit them best.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

The set up for this quiz is pretty simple: download the html file and launch it in your favorite browser. It has only been tested on Chrome so if that's your favorite then there shouldn't be many issues!

## Known Bugs

The current version has no known serious bugs. After completing the questionnaire you need to refresh the page again before trying another go at it. This is basically a bug that hasn't been dealt with yet.

## Support and contact details

If you'd like to get in touch that would be great! My email address is theluvq@gmail.com and I check it often.

## Technologies Used

To craft this quiz I used a text editor called Atom. Bootstrap and jQuery for JavaScript jazz and Google Chrome for testing.
